# Tic Tac Toe in Go

This small project is an example of how you can use my module [gotictactoe](github.com/lelledaniele/gotictactoe).

It was fun to develop Tic Tac Toe.
However, I will stop to improve this package, and I will concentrate on other projects to learn Golang.

## How to use it

### Play the game

`go run main.go <n>`
